# Old Snake Remake

## Description

This is a recreation/remake of the old Snake game, written in Pygame. I'm still new to programming, so I'm improving this game as I learn more (since it's not nearly finished yet).

## Features and Stuff

- Basic game menus (Main menu, pause, and game over menu)
- Clickable buttons with visual movement and sound
- Basic music and sounds
- Moving snake and randomly spawning food
- Basic score counter and high score
- Pause menu with continue, restart, and working main menu button (finally)
- Not much more for now lmao
